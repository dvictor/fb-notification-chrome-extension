fb-notification-chrome-extension
================================

This is a simple Chrome extension that will display a desktop notification if
the Facebook tab has a new notification.

I made this because I keep Facebook open on a secondary desktop in a Gnome DE on Linux.

Ther's probably plenty of extensions doing this and much more but I
didn't want to allow a 3rd party access my Facebook data.

Installation:
* open chrome://extensions/
* activate developer mode
* drag this directory in the extension tab
